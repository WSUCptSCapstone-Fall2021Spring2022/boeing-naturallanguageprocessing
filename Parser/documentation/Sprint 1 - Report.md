## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * We were able to set-up a good way for all of us to communicate
  * We were able to set-up a way to get us on the same schedule (KANBAN)
  * We met up with the mentors and learned about the high level overview behind this project
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Knowing more about the code and the lower-level details
   * Getting to play around with the software that the last team created
   * Learning more about what we are actually going to be doing at a low-level
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * We want communicate more often, and be more on top of communicating with our mentors

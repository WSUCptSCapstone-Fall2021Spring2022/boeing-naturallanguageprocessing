with any game made for mobile phones, PDAs, etc.

Game genres
However, the classification of games is not always consistent and can 
be somewhat arbitrary. Does this really matter?
For some food for thought read 
Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_Investigations
adventure games; action games; action-adventure games; platform games; fighting games; first-person shooter games; real-time 
strategy games; turn-based strategy games; role playing games; massively multiplayer online games; stealth games; survival horror 
games; simulation games; racing games; sports games; rythm games; puzzle games; board games; educational games; serious games.
Games are often classified into genres, which purport to define games in 
terms of having a common style or set of characteristics, e.g. as defined 
in terms of perspective, gameplay, interaction, objective, etc. 
Game Genres
Adventure games
• Typically the player is the protagonist of a story 
and in order to progress must solve puzzles. The 
puzzles can often involve manipulating and 
interacting with in-game objects, characters, etc.
• Text-based adventures and graphical
• Examples:
– Zork
– King’s Quest 
– Grim Fandango 
– Fahrenheit

Game Genres
Action games
• A number of other action-oriented genres can be broadly 
classified as belonging to this genre. Action games are 
typified by fast-paced events and movement which often 
have to be performed reflexively. 
• Games such as Pong and Space Invaders initially 
defined the genre.
Game Genres
Action-adventure games
• Action-adventure games can be described in terms of a 
blend of the characteristics associated with both 
adventure and action games, i.e. often involving both 
exploration and puzzle solving alongside fast-paced action 
sequences.
• Adventure on Atari 2600 can be considered as initially 
defining this genre. 
• Other notable (more recent) examples include:
– Legend of Zelda
– Jak 3
– Metroid Prime 2
Game Genres
Platform games aka platformers
• This genre often requires the protagonist to run and jump 
between surfaces (i.e. platforms) whilst avoiding game 
objects and the detrimental effects of gravity.
• Traditionally, platform games were side-on 2D in 
perspective and very popular on earlier gaming platforms.
• The genre has declined in popularity in recent years, 
although some titles have successfully redefined the genre 
to include 3D environments. 
• Exemplos:
– Pitfall! 
– Super Mario Bros
– Sonic the Hedgehog 
– Super Mario 64
– Tomb Raider
– Prince of Persia
Game Genres
Fighting games
• In fighting games the player typically fights other players or 
the computer in some form of one-on-one combat.
• Notable classics include:
– Double Dragon
– Mortal Kombat
– Street Fighter 
• More recent renditions include:
– Virtua Fighter
– Tekken
Game Genres
First-person shooter (FPS) games
• Action games where the player is “behind the eyes” of the 
game character in a first-person perspective. Although a 
number of FPS games also support third-person views.
• Most FPSs are fast-paced and typically require actions to be 
performed reflexively.
• Notable examples include:
– Wolfenstein 3D 
– DOOM
– Half-Life
– Far Cry
– F.E.A.R.
Game Genres
Real-time strategy (RTS) games
• RTS games typically defined a number of goals around 
resource collection, base and unit construction and 
engagement in combat with other players or computer 
opponents who also share similar goals.
• Emphasis is often placed upon managing logistics, resources 
and production.
• Notable examples include:
– Dune 2
– Command and Conquer
– Warcraft
– Age of Empires
Game Genres
Turn-based strategy games
• Turn-based games share similar aims to real-time strategy 
games although players take turns in much the same was as 
with many traditional board games. 
• Notable examples include:
– Civilization 
– X-COM
– Master of Orion
– Jagged Alliance
• There is a recent trend towards hybrid games that include 
elements of both turn-based and real-time games, e.g. 
Rome Total War

• Originally started out as video games based on pen and 
pencil games like Dungeons and Dragons. A fantasy theme

resolution, etc.

Game Genres
Massively multiplayer online 
role-playing games (MMRPGs)
• Typically a RPG set in a persistent virtual world populated 
by thousands of other players. MMORPGs can be viewed 
as evolving from text-based MUDs in mid-to-late 1990s.
• The first highly popular MMORPG was Ultima Online
whilst World of Warcraft holds the honor of being the 
current most popular.
• Aside: Apart from MMOPRGs there are also sizeable 
communities around online first person shooters and 
strategy games, e.g. Battlefield 2
Game Genres

or precision play. 
• Notable examples include:

Game Genres
Survival horror games

with a focus on fear and survival and adopting 
many of the elements of traditional horror fiction.

example, whilst the Resident Evil series is a 
current notable example.
Game Genres
Simulation games
• Many simulation games aim to simulate physical 
activities such as flying an aircraft (Microsoft 
Flight Simulator), playing golf or football etc. 
(sometimes with as much realism as possible). 
• Other forms of simulation game aim to provide 
simulations of forms of management, e.g. football 
management games, city management (SimCity), 
railroading, etc. 
• Often the simulation is intended to be fun as 
opposed to accurate, e.g. Wing Commander 
and X3 are notable space combat simulation 
games
• Others popular games in this category include 
The Sims series where the player ‘controls’ the 
lives of computer characters.
Game Genres
Racing games

wheel and involve competing in a race against 
other drivers and/or time. Two sub-genre can be 
identified: simulation and arcade.

including sports such as football, baseball, golf, 
boxing, skate boarding, ice hockey, tennis, etc.

experience of playing the sport, whilst others 
focus on the strategy behind the sport.
• Notable examples include:
– John Madden Football 
– Tiger Woods’ Golf

Game Genres
Rhythm games (music games)
• Rhythm games require the player to undertake 
some action (e.g. follow a sequence of movement 
or develop specific rhythms) in response to some 
stimulus (often music). 
• Often the games require specialised controllers 
such as dance pads. 
• Dance Dance Revolution is the best known 
example.
Game Genres

puzzles or problems and can involve the exercise 
of logic, memory, pattern matching, reaction time, 
etc.

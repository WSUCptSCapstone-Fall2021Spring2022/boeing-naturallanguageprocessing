 * Feature 8: Added ability to parse .txt and .doc files
 * Feature 9: Added frequency and weight


## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
Our team continued to work on the parser this sprint, with insturctions and advice given to us by our mentors at Boeing. We were able to implement what they asked of us, and we are getting very close to moving forward to working on the taxonomy creation. As for long term goals, we have decided that we will be creating a front end.

## Unfinished Work
There are still exceptions that need to be handled in the parser. We anticipate that more will continue to be found as we test more documents, and this will be an ongoing task to fix them. We also need to start researching taxonomy creation APIs to deteremine which would be the best fit for our project.

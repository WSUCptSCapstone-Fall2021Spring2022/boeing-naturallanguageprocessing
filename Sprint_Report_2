# Sprint 2 Report (10/22/21)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Bug Fix 1: Fix parsing bugs
 * Feature 2: BootCat
 * Feature 3: Weight dictionary creation
 * Feature 4: Tagging

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
Our team first created a diagram to break down the issues into their relative parts. We spent a good deal of time collaborating togther to make sure we all understood the processes before we started coding.
We then assigned these parts to each other and started the coding. We had to learn about new API's and also how the old code was implemented. We also learned more about the Natrual Language Process, as well as how to work with .CSV files.
All in all, we were able to make a rough prototype which helped us better understand our project, however, we will most likely be dropping all of this and instead focus on improving the current parser.

## Unfinished Work
The taxonomy building process is still immature, and therefore doesn't work efficiently or very accurately. We we're able to get a working protoype done in time, however, our main focus will be shifting to upgrading the parser.

## Completed Issues/User Stories
Here are links to the issues that we completed in this sprint:

 * https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2021Spring2022/boeing-naturallanguageprocessing/issues/2
 * https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2021Spring2022/boeing-naturallanguageprocessing/issues/5
 * https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2021Spring2022/boeing-naturallanguageprocessing/issues/7#

 * Each completed pull request should include a link to a "Before and After" video
 
 ## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
 Here are links to issues we worked on but did not complete in this sprint:
 
 * https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2021Spring2022/boeing-naturallanguageprocessing/issues/9
   - We were able to get a working protoype, but it is very innacurate and inefficent

## Code Files for Review
Please review the following code files, which were actively developed during this sprint, for quality:
 * [Parser](https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2021Spring2022/boeing-naturallanguageprocessing/tree/main/Parser)
 * [Txonomy](https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2021Spring2022/boeing-naturallanguageprocessing/tree/main/Taxonomy)
 
## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * We were able to implement BootCaT to find extra corpus material
  * We were able to convert .txt to .pdf
  * We were able to create a weighted dictionary from the .pdf's
  * We were able to make a prototype of the taxonomy
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Parser accuracy
   * Taxonomy accuracy
   * Instead of using BootCaT, implement our own version
   * Ability to parse .txt and .docx
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * We will mainly focus on improving the parser
     - Ability to parse .txt and .docx natively
     - Ability to swap API's in parser
     - Ability to test accuracy of API's
     - Creation of a exception module
     - Ability to parse noun phrases
     - Ability to parse foreign language phrases

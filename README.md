## Project summary

### One-sentence description of the project

The Boeing Natural Language Processing project aims to innovate our understanding of the world, providing general taxonomy based on the "aboutness".

### Additional information about the project

The taxonomy created by the NLP process has many uses: to translate difficult vocabulary to a general vocabulary, to power the search engines of 
the future and possibly much more.

Our goal for this year is to have a project with a good enough taxonomy to be beleivable. Not so much to have production grade software. This project can
be divided into the following parts:
1. Parse nouns from various file types (PDF currently supported)
2. Gain knowledge and context of each noun
3. Find the frequency and weights of each noun(partially completed)
4. Develop taxonomy based on the weights of each word (goal to arrive at by semesters end)
5. Develop a powerful UI for the front end

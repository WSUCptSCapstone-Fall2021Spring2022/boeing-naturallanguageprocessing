# Sprint 6 Report (03/02/22)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Feature 1: Implemented pagination in the front end react tables to improve performance
 * Feature 2: Implemented CRUD operations to save corpus to one CSV
 * Feature 3: Implemented save visualization relationship and category data 
 

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
Our team focused on creating CRUD operations for for master and relationship CSV along with improving performance in the front end by introducing pagination.


## Unfinished Work
Loading relationships from a CSV.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * We were able to further improve our front-end with performance changes and continued implementation of a working interactive taxonomy visualization
  * We were able to mostly complete CRUD operations
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Test parsing larger documents and corpora
   * Improve front end UI/UX
   
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * More parser exceptions (continual)
   * Improvements to taxonomy visualization like displaying noun/noun-phrase context as a pop up
   * Load relationship data
   * Refactor codebase 
   * Create a Docker container to standardize our build environment
   * Test cases for user interface

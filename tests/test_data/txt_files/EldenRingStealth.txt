Stealth mechanics seem that will be present and may be useful in combination with backstab attacks, also the game may feature a night and day mechanic that may affect the stealth mechanic as well. Stealth as many are aware of, will allow the player to crouch, sneak, and hide behind tall grass to be less detected by the enemy. Stealth will play an integral mechanic in combat since you can use it to your advantage to sneak behind an enemy to instantly kill them or at least deal a large amount of damage from using a stealth attack.

Stealth not only focuses on hiding or using it as way to gain the upper hand towards your enemies, but you can also use this tactic to reposition yourself in various sections of a dungeon or to assess the situation that lies ahead so that you can properly act. According to Hidetaka Miyazaki, they wanted to create these opportunities for players to see what lies ahead of them and below them and around them and to assess how they're going to confront that, or not as the case may be. So stealth, while again it's a simple implementation, it allows for a lot more of these possibilities.

It's also believed that the new jump mechanic will give the players a consistent jump, that may not require to run a short distance previously. Miyazaki stated that the game will put more focus on RPG aspects, but responsive melee-based combat will be present.  Mounted Combat is a confirmed feature of the game. A wide variety of unique and horrifying bosses is also expected. It is also believed that combat will be conditioned by the environment and maybe also the weather conditions of the location where the combat is taking part.

Sneak attacks not only deal critical damage, they also seem to have a better chance to inflict an Effect from your weapons.

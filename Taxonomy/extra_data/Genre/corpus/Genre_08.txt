Narita Boy
The atmosphere in Narita Boy is everything, appeals to nostalgia, arouses emotions, generates connections and enhances empathy with experience. The environment as a vehicle to channel the narrative and stimulate the player to experience what we want to evoke on him. We play with the penumbra to highlight the three fundamental colors of the game. Three color shades that are repeated throughout the game as the fundamental axis of the narrative, three colors, the Trichrome that is as important as the main character. Three colors as narrative axis each being a protagonist in the history of the game. Color and atmosphere are everything in Narita Boy. Everything.

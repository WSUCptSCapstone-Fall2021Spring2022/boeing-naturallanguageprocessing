<s>Create New Since video games are visual by definition, it's of course important to see what's going on.</s>
<s>Save for the rare invisible enemy or Interface Screw , not being able to see what you need in a game can make it frustrating instead of fun.</s>
<s>When dealing with 2D graphics, it's relatively simple to make the viewing clear.</s>
<s>Everything's on a single plane, and then it's just a matter of designing the levels well.</s>
<s>Even in faux 3D, it's still on a single plane.</s>
<s>Heck, even in the earliest Polygonal Graphics , either movement was limited, the levels were auto-scrolled, or the games were in first person.</s>
<s>Advertisement: But then third person 3D graphics advanced enough to allow free movement, and it stopped being simple.</s>
<s>It turned out no matter the view chosen, even the best designed games were at risk for Camera Screw (and with not-so-well designed games, it was a certainty).</s>
<s>Thus it could become vital to not only design levels for best visibility, but also to choose the best camera.</s>
<s>Should the camera be locked, or should the player have control over the camera?</s>
<s>And if the latter, which kind of control?</s>
<s>So as you can see, there are lots of choices for how a developer shows a game, "But choose wisely" .</s>

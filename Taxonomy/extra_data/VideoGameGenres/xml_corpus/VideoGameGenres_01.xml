<s>Testers usually run through what is called matrix testing, where they have to test every permutation and combination of events that could possibly happen in a game to ensure that nothing can break it.</s>
<s>There are really no essential educational credentials to have when it comes to QA testing video games.</s>
<s>However, these testers need to have an eye for details, a tolerance for repetition and an intense passion for the gaming industry.</s>

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
We have been working dillegently to reach code completion and we have all but done so. For all intents and purposes we are done with the applications
functionality. Additionially, we have been working on refactoring our code base to be cleaner and more maintainable. It's definetly hard with our time 
crunch as we all have more competing tasks due in other courses and in life.

## Unfinished Work
Containerization and testing are the only things to be completed this next month. There are some minor bugs however they aren't super important to fix.
